  "readme": "coffee-script-mapped\n====================\n\nAt the moment the coffee-script node.js module lacks proper support for stack-traces when compile coffeescript files.\nThis module adds the correct line and column indication in stack-traces for coffee-script modules loaded with require() or parsed using the coffeem command (which replaces coffee command).\n\nto install :\n\n`npm install coffee-script-mapped`\n\nto run as a command line you can call `coffeem` (which works exactly as the coffee command, except it'll have proper stacktraces)\n\nNotes:\n\n* the \"coffee-script-mapped\" module exports the coffee-script module, so you can use it wherever you used the coffee-script module\n* this module does not provide the \"coffee-script\" module, you need to provide it on you own (this is so that any version can be used)\n* this module caches sourcemaps for all coffee-scripts, so it might create some overhead. \n* you can pass `--no-source-maps` to the node or coffeem commands to disable this module (which will revert to the standard coffee-script module)\n\n\nLicense MIT:\nhttp://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\n\nAcknowledgments:\n* part of this code was copied and modified from https://github.com/evanw/node-source-map-support ",
